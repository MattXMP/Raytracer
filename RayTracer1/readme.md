This is a basic implementation of a C++ based raytracer. My implementation is modified from th book series "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", written by Peter Shirley, Trevor D Black, and Steve Hollasch. While this code can be used to generate a .ppm image as described in the series, I'm also attempting to build in texture generation through SDL. I've used cmake to generate the binaries for my builds, and will be uploading them in totality here.
